# CANDIDE :deciduous_tree:

## Description :speech_balloon:
Candide is an open source project that aims primarily to display terrains and plants in 3D based on previously provided data. It has its roots in another open source project called Vana Principia, which aims to provide a tool that can scan a terrain and provide the user with recommendations for plants that are suitable for their environment and how these will interact. (To know more about this project fill free to visite their website [https://www.vanaprincipia.fr/](https://www.vanaprincipia.fr/))

The Candide project offers a simple and easy-to-use user interface in high resolution for the most immersive user experience possible. Users can explore different types of plants, such as trees, flowers... as well as their placement on specific terrains. They also have access to various data concerning all the displayed plants.

Other things to include:

  - **Technology stack**: Indicate the technological nature of the software, including primary programming language(s) and whether the software is intended as standalone or as a module in a framework or other ecosystem.
  - **Status**:  Alpha, Beta, 1.1, etc. It's OK to write a sentence, too. The goal is to let interested people know where this project is at. This is also a good place to link to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
  - Describe what sets this apart from related-projects. Linking to another doc or page is OK if this can't be expressed in a sentence or two.


**Screenshot**: If the software has visual components, place a screenshot after the description; e.g.,

## Dependencies

Describe any dependencies that must be installed for this software to work.
This includes programming languages, databases or other storage mechanisms, build tools, frameworks, and so forth.
If specific versions of other software are required, or known not to work, call that out.

## Installation :gear:

If you're new to React Router, we recommend you start with the tutorial.

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
