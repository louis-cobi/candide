# CANDIDE :deciduous_tree:

## Description :speech_balloon:

Candide is an open source project that aims primarily to display terrains and plants in 3D based on previously provided data. It has its roots in another open source project called Vana Principia, which aims to provide a tool that can scan a terrain and provide the user with recommendations for plants that are suitable for their environment and how these will interact. (To know more about this project fill free to visite their website [https://www.vanaprincipia.fr/](https://www.vanaprincipia.fr/))

The Candide project offers a simple and easy-to-use user interface in high resolution for the most immersive user experience possible. Users can explore different types of plants, such as trees, flowers... as well as their placement on specific terrains. They also have access to various data concerning all the displayed plants.

  - **Authors**: Christopher BOLARD / LÃ©o LABEAUME / Louis COBIGO / Manon LAVENIER
  - **Technology stack**: This project is mainly based on React Three Fiber.
  - **Status**:  1.0.0 Every change would be notified into [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation :gear:

### First thing first, you need to setup the project :

1. Fork the repo (click the Fork button at the top right of this page)
2. Clone your fork locally in a terminal
3. cd to parent directory where you want your clone to be, 
4. ```git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/candide.git```
5. ```cd candide```


### Once you have open the project in your favorite IDE open the terminal and run :

**```npm install```** 

Add a folder name ```models``` at the root then add all the necessary models.
You can find all models in this drive :[Models files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D3G-_I8TR3O_4E8dm6BXLe3TgPDZHaIX?usp=share_link)

**`npm start`**

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) than TADAM :sparkles: you can view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Usage :books:
As mentioned earlier, the main objective of this project is to represent data in 3D format. Therefore, all display is based on reading a data file that we created in JSON format.

The Json should look like this :

```
{
    "env": {
        "type" : "sand"
        "light": {
            "var1":100,
            "var2":10,
            "var3":100 
        },
        "x": 100,
        "y": 100
    },

    "plants" : [
        {
            "name" : "huaranhuay",
            "x" : 30,
            "y" : 70,
            "description" : {
                "type" : "tree",
                "size" : "big",
                "width" : 100,
                "height" : 100,
                "text" : "This is a tree",
                "watering" : "once a week",
                "wateringAmount" : "1 liter",
                "flowering" : "2024-01-01",
                "family" : "oak"
            }

        },

        {
            "name" : "pisonay",
            "x" : 80,
            "y" : 40,
            "description" : {
                "type" : "flower",
                "size" : "big",
                "width" : 100,
                "height" : 100,
                "text" : "This is a flower",
                "watering" : "once a week",
                "wateringAmount" : "1 liter",
                "flowering" : "2024-01-01",
                "family" : "oak"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
| Variable | Explanation |
| -------- | ------- |
| "type" | For now grass or sand  |
| "name" | Should be the same as the model  |
| "x" | Represents its placement on the x-axis  |
| "y" | Represents its placement on the y-axis  |
